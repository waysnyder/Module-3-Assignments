    "## Homework 01: First Steps with Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework will introduce you to foundational techniques in downloading and setting up datasets, running `sklearn` models, and examining their results. The primary goal is to establish the workflow for accessing and submitting assignments, writing basic code, and interpreting outputs. This assignment will also help us test the autograder and ensure that feedback mechanisms work seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Instructions via Gradescope\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Gradescope for homework submissions this term. Please follow these instructions carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Absolutely do not do either of these**, which will cause the autograder to fail, resulting in a 0 for the assignment or that problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Do not rename the file**: It must be submitted as  **`Homework_01.ipynb`**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Do not make any changes to the cells containing the grading code**, e.g.,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "            # Graded Answer\n",
    "            # DO NOT change this cell in any way          \n",
    "\n",
    "            print(f'a1 = ${a1:,}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify before submission**  \n",
    "   - Before submitting, run `Restart Kernel and Run All` to ensure that all cells execute without errors. We do **not** run your notebook before grading it. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Submitting to Gradescope**  \n",
    "   - You should have received an email inviting you to join Gradescope. If not, please contact us immediately.  \n",
    "   - Log in to [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com), navigate to your dashboard, and locate **Homework 01**.  \n",
    "   - Drag and drop the following file into the upload section:\n",
    "     - **`Homework_01.ipynb`**\n",
    "   - Click `Upload` to submit your file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Review your submission**  \n",
    "   - You will receive a confirmation email after submission.\n",
    "   - You will receive the autograder results on Saturday morning after the last late deadline has passed; we will also inform you of the expected results.  \n",
    "   - For the first two homeworks, **multiple resubmissions** will be allowed and **no late penalty** will be applied. Use this opportunity to get your debugging and submission workflow established.   \n",
    "   - Starting from Homework 03, **only one submission will be permitted** and the **late penalty** (10% per date late up to 5 days) will be applied. You will need to ensure that your work is complete and carefully verified before uploading.\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. **Review your grade**\n",
    "  - We will inform you of the expected results after grading. We do not distribute full solutions.\n",
    "  - If you believe there is a problem with your grades, you may submit a **regrade request** on Gradescope. Please be specific. Requests such as \"Please regrade the entire assignment\" will result in our repeating the previous sentence. Regrade requests must be made within two weeks of receiving your grade. "
