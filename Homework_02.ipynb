    "# Homework 02:  Linear Regression in Theory and Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you’ll work with a simple synthetic regression dataset generated using scikit-learn’s make_regression function. Synthetic data is a valuable tool for testing modeling workflows, gaining hands-on experience with regression models, and understanding how factors like noise and training set size impact model performance—particularly when measured by metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE). Because we control how the dataset is generated, we can directly assess how well our model recovers the underlying patterns. You’ll also practice splitting data into training and test sets to evaluate how well your model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions will require you to consult the scikit-learn documentation. These functions are widely used in machine learning, and becoming comfortable with reading documentation and examples is an essential part of developing fluency with the tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the first assignment, some tasks are not graded, but that doesn’t mean they are optional. Skipping these steps will weaken your understanding and reduce the long-term value of your effort. Treat every part of the homework seriously—you’ll thank yourself later when you take on real-world projects and more advanced modules.\n",

You can control key parameters like the number of samples and the noise level (standard deviation of the errors), though some settings—such as the feature value ranges or the true coefficients—are randomly generated or limited in configurability (e.g., you can set the bias, but not the coefficients directly).\n",
